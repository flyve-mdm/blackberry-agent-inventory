The Inventory Agent will scan your device and gather all the hardware and software data, such as memory, applications, battery, etc., in a beautiful XML file or JSON format. The inventory can be send to:

- Fusion Inventory for GLPI 2.3.x and higher
- OCSInventory NG (ocsng) 1.3.x and 2.x
- Mandriva Pulse2

Before running your inventory, you must define your server address and credentials, so the inventory can be sent automatically to your account. 

You have several options to manage the inventory, some of the most important:

- Show my inventory which allows you to see a display of your inventory.
- Disable/Enable the inventory.
